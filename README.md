# SMC_groundwater
This is the code associated with the article 'Rare event probability estimation for groundwater inverse problems with a two-stage Sequential Monte Carlo approach' published in Water Resources Research. The folder includes the code for the one-dimensional flow and the two-dimensional transport example. 

2D_transport example: The 'cm_chol' matrix is missing in 'Data_occ1.mat', however, it can be generated within the 'gen_data.py' file.
